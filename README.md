[1]"Forbidden"
In professional Gomoku (Five-in-a-Row), forbidden rules balance Black's first-move advantage. These restrictions apply exclusively to Black:
Overlines: Creating 6+ consecutive stones in an unbroken line results in instant loss.
Double Three: Forming two separate "live threes" (three-stone lines with open ends) simultaneously.
Double Four: Establishing two independent "live fours" (four-stone lines with open ends) in one move.
